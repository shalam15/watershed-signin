This is a project I am working on for the city of Atlanta. I always try to fix any issues I see in a place I work, just to make a mark. I also Use it to pass the very boring hours I have have to work.

This software can also be used by any company to replace their current manual paperwork entry.
A couple of things though:
1. I am always learning and this project is not supposed to be run unless proper permission is granted from me
2. All changes might include code that might be dangerous to your computer, if permission isn't granted, RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK
3. All Right to this software is reserved.
4. All images currently in use in any part of this software is not mine, It would be replaced before deploying.
